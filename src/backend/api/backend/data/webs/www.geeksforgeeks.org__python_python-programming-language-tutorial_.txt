Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It’s simple to use, packed with features and supported by a wide range of libraries and frameworks. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly.
A high-level language, used in data science, automation, AI, web development and more.
Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand and maintain.
Backed by strong library support, we don’t have to build everything from scratch.
Basic Code Example
The following is a simple program that displays the message “Hello, World!” on the screen.
# Python Program to Print Hello World!
"Hello World!"
Hello World!
Python Introduction
for Complete Tutorial.
Why Learn Python?
Requires fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages like Java.
Provides Libraries / Frameworks like Django, Flask and many more for Web Development, and Pandas, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn and many more for, AI/ML, Data Science and Data Analysis
Cross-platform, works on Windows, Mac and Linux without major changes.
Used by top tech companies like Google, Netflix and NASA.
Many Python coding job opportunities in Software Development, Data Science and AI/ML.
In this section, we’ll cover the basics of Python programming, including installing Python, writing first program, understanding comments and working with variables, keywords and operators. Before starting to learn python we need to
install python
on our system.
Introduction
Applications
Input and Output
Conditional Statements
Control Flow
In this section of Python 3 tutorial we'll explore Python function syntax, parameter handling, return values and variable scope. Along the way, we'll also introduce versatile functions like range(), map, filter and lambda functions.
Pass Statement in Function
Global and Local Variables
*args and **kwargs in Function
‘Self’ as Default Argument
First Class Function
Lambda Function
Filter Function
Inner Function
Data Structures
Python offers versatile collections of data types, including lists, string, tuples, sets, dictionaries and arrays. In this section, we will learn about each data types in detail.
List Comprehension
List Comprehension
Python's collections module offers essential data structures, including the following:

OOP Concepts
In this section, we'll explore the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. From encapsulation to inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and iterators, we'll cover the essential concepts that helps you to build modular, reusable and scalable code.
Classes and Objects
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Exception Handling
In this section, we'll explore Python Exception Handling that how Python deals with unexpected errors, enabling us to write fault-tolerant code. We'll cover file handling, including reading from and writing to files.
Exception Handling
Built-in Exception
User defined Exception
Exception Handling
File Handling
In this section, we will cover file handling, including reading from and writing to files.
File Handling
Write/Create Files
pathlib Module
Directory Management
File Handling
Database Handling
In this section we will learn how to access and work with MySQL and MongoDB databases

Packages or Libraries
Python is a huge collection of Python Packages standard libraries that make development easier. These libraries help with a wide range of tasks and can save you a lot of time by providing ready-to-use tools.
Some commonly used types of libraries in Python include:
Built-in Modules
DSA Libraries
GUI Libraries
Data Science
1. Foundational Libraries
: These are the libraries that form the base for all data science work. Start here to build a strong foundation.
2. Advanced Visualization and Statistical Tools:
Once you’re comfortable with basic data handling and visualization, move to creating cleaner visuals and performing statistical analysis.
3. Machine Learning Libraries:
After data manipulation and visualization, learn machine learning, starting with simpler models and moving to advanced ones.
Scikit-learn
Deep Learning Frameworks:
If you’re interested in AI and deep learning, these libraries will allow you to build and train neural networks.
